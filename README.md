# 👋 Hi, I’m @Copia-web

Welcome to my space! I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with a love for crafting beautiful and functional web experiences. I enjoy building full-stack applications and bringing creative ideas to life through code.

- 👀 I’m interested in web development, open source projects, UI/UX design, frontend architecture, and performance optimization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced TypeScript, system design, and exploring backend technologies like Node.js and MongoDB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on modern web applications, developer tools, and community-based tech initiatives.
- 📫 How to reach me: [copia.dev@email.com](mailto:raymondasante69@gmail.com) |
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started coding because I wanted to build my own music streaming site — and now I’m building apps that power real businesses!
